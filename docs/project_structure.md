# Project Structure

The **Flutter Starter Kit** follows a modular structure. Here's a breakdown of the folders and files:

## `lib/`

The `lib/` directory contains all the Flutter code.

- **core/**: Contains common utilities, services, and error handling.

  - **config/**: Configuration files (environment variables, constants).
  - **errors/**: Custom error classes and exceptions.
  - **network/**: Network services (Dio setup, API calls).
  - **utils/**: Utility classes (e.g., formatters, validators).

- **features/**: Each feature is contained within its own directory.

  - **auth/**: User authentication (sign in, sign up, forgot password).
  - **user/**: User profile management, settings, and preferences.
  - **dashboard/**: Dashboard features (stats, charts, widgets).
  - **notifications/**: Push and in-app notifications.
  - **tasks/**: Task management (CRUD, status tracking).
  - **settings/**: App preferences and user settings.

- **shared/**: Contains reusable UI components and shared functionality.

  - **widgets/**: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, loaders).
  - **theme/**: Custom themes and color schemes.
  - **extensions/**: Extensions for common Flutter objects.

- **app.dart**: App entry point, sets up routing, themes, etc.
- **main.dart**: Initializes the app and runs it.

## Key Files

- `pubspec.yaml`: Project dependencies
