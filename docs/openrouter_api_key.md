# How to Get Your OpenRouter AI API Key

This guide will walk you through the steps to obtain your API key from OpenRouter, which is necessary for the AI chat features in this application.

## What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is a platform that provides access to various large language models (LLMs) through a single API. This project uses OpenRouter to integrate AI capabilities.

## Steps to Get Your API Key

1.  **Visit the OpenRouter Website:**
    Go to the OpenRouter website: [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)

2.  **Sign Up or Log In:**
    If you don't have an account, you'll need to sign up. If you already have an account, simply log in.

3.  **Navigate to Your Account/API Keys:**
    Once logged in, look for a section related to "Account," "API Keys," "Settings," or "Dashboard." This is usually accessible from your profile icon or a navigation menu.

4.  **Generate a New API Key:**
    On the API Keys page, you should find an option to "Generate New Key" or "Create API Key." Click this button.

5.  **Copy Your API Key:**
    After generating, your new API key will be displayed. **Copy this key immediately** as it might not be shown again for security reasons.

6.  **Add to Your Project's `.env` file:**
    Now that you have your API key, you can add it to your project's `.env` file as instructed in the `README.md`.

    Example:
    ```
    OPENROUTER_AI_API_KEY='your_copied_api_key_here'
    ```

**Important:** Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
