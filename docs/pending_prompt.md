I want to integrate a smart API system. which functionality is highly reusable, strictly use riverpod architecture, scalable, clean code, good documentation, which will offline priority │
│ online sync. show me full structure of this feature and one by one i will integrate this. show my code and documentation with proper commenting. make 2 way data flow , When a user creates, updates, or deletes a task, the change will be saved immediately to the local Hive database. The UI will update instantly from this
local data, making the app feel fast and responsive, even with no internet connection.
When the app is online, a synchronization mechanism will push any local changes (like new or updated tasks) to the remote server via the API. \* It will also fetch any updates from the server and save them to the local Hive database.
