Certainly, Rahat. As a **solo developer**, adopting a structured Git workflow with staging, testing, and code reviews **will help maintain clean, scalable code and prepare you for freelance/team collaboration** in the future.

Below is a **step-by-step flow** tailored for solo development, including proper Git practices and milestone gates (coding, review, testing, release).

---

## 🧭 Solo Git-Based Project Management Flow

### 🌱 Stage 0: Project Planning / Task Breakdown

Before you even write code:

1. **Define the Feature:**
   Example: _"Implement API service layer using Dio, Freezed, and JsonSerializable."_

2. **Break Down the Task:**

   - Setup Dio client
   - Create model classes (Freezed + JsonSerializable)
   - Create API abstraction/service
   - Error handling integration
   - Testing (optional but recommended)

3. **Document Task in README/Notion/Jira (for yourself)**

---

## 🚀 Stage 1: Git Setup and Branching

### ✅ Setup Branches (First time only)

```bash
git checkout -b main
git push origin main

git checkout -b OnDevelopment
git push origin OnDevelopment
```

From now on, you’ll always branch off from `OnDevelopment`.

---

### 🌿 Step 1: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout OnDevelopment
git pull origin OnDevelopment
git checkout -b feature/api-service
```

---

## 🛠️ Stage 2: Development Phase

1. **Write your code**

   - Set up Dio client
   - Use `freezed`, `json_serializable` for models
   - Abstract API calls into clean services

2. **Commit your progress frequently**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add user service with Dio and Freezed"
```

3. **Push feature branch to remote (for backup & later PR)**

```bash
git push origin feature/api-service
```

---

## 🔍 Stage 3: Self Review (Solo Code Review)

Before merging to `OnDevelopment`:

1. **Review your code using GitHub/GitLab**

   - Use the Pull Request interface like a reviewer
   - Look for:

     - Clean architecture
     - Naming consistency
     - Proper error handling
     - Comments and docs
     - Avoid large uncommitted chunks

2. **If needed: fix & push again**

```bash
# Make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response properly"
git push origin feature/api-service
```

---

## 🧪 Stage 4: Manual or Automated Testing

1. **Switch to `OnDevelopment` branch and pull latest**

```bash
git checkout OnDevelopment
git pull origin OnDevelopment
```

2. **Merge your feature branch**

```bash
git merge feature/api-service
```

3. **Test the app manually or via unit/integration tests**

   - Run all flows using the new API
   - Check edge cases
   - Add logs if needed

4. **Push merged dev branch to remote**

```bash
git push origin OnDevelopment
```

---

## 🚦 Stage 5: Prepare for Production (Stable Release)

Once the feature is tested and stable in `OnDevelopment`:

1. **Switch to main**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. **Merge changes from OnDevelopment**

```bash
git merge OnDevelopment
```

3. **Tag version (optional but recommended)**

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial API service release"
git push origin --tags
```

4. **Push to production**

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Tooling Suggestions

| Tool                       | Purpose                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Dio**                    | Network calls                   |
| **Freezed**                | Data classes with union types   |
| **JsonSerializable**       | JSON parsing                    |
| **very_good_analysis**     | Code quality checks             |

## 🧠 Tip: Use GitHub Pull Request Templates

Even for yourself. Add `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
### What was done?

- Added Dio service for User API
- Implemented UserModel using Freezed

### Checklist

- [x] Code is clean
- [x] Freezed classes are generated
- [x] Tested manually
- [ ] Added unit tests (if possible)
```

Would you like me to generate a ready-made example of the Dio + Freezed setup and how to manage it in this structure with commit messages and commands?
